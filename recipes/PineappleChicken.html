        <li>1 teaspon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can sliced pineapple in juice, drained - divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to Prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix together the light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, thyme, cumin, 1 teaspoon of garlic salt, paprika, chili powder, and nutmeg in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Rub both sides of chicken breasts with the spice mixture, and place into a 9x9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle any remaining seasoning mix on top of chicken, if desired.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is lightly browned, no longer pink inside, and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chicken breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While chicken is baking, bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Chop half the pineapple slices. Mix the chopped pineapple, cilantro, and olive oil into the cooked rice, and season to taste with a pinch or two of garlic salt and black pepper. Fluff the rice up with a fork, and transfer to a serving platter. Serve with the baked chicken, topped with remaining pineapple slices.</li>
